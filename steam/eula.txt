[b][u]The Red Eclipse Multiplayer Guidelines[/u][/b]

The Red Eclipse Team provides the play.redeclipse.net master server for the benefit of the Red Eclipse community. We impose a general set of guidelines for any server/user which connects to the play.redeclipse.net master server. The Red Eclipse Team reserves the right to block any attempt to connect to the master server at their discretion. Access to services provided by the project are considered to be a privilege, not a right.

These guidelines are imposed to ensure the integrity of both the Red Eclipse game and the surrounding community. If you do not agree to these terms, you should not connect to the play.redeclipse.net master server, or any servers which are connected to it. These guidelines are not designed to limit your opinions or freedoms granted to you by the open source licenses employed by the project, nor do they cover usage of the game in either offline play or on servers which are not connected to the Red Eclipse master. If you do not agree to these terms you are still able to run the game without the use of the master server.

If you have questions or comments regarding these guidelines please contact the Red Eclipse Team. Any person seeking to modify their game or server for use on the master server should first seek permission from the Red Eclipse Team, each modification must be approved and will be done on a case-by-case basis. It is advised you create a topic in the "General Discussion" section of the official Red Eclipse discussions located at https://redeclipse.net/discuss

NOTE: By playing online you consent to the disclosure of certain information for legitimate administration and moderation purposes. This includes, but is not limited to: Username, Steam ID and handle, Discord handle, IP address, Hardware configuration, and Operating system details.

[b]Guidelines for Servers[/b]

(See RE Mark Policy for definitions of "substantially (un)modified")

The gameplay of the server must not grant an unfavorable advantage or disservice to any party.

[list]
[*] "Humans vs Zombies" is fine, as long as it rotates roles in a fair manner.
[*] Giving one player double the health of other players permanently is not permitted.
[*] Game variables may not be set in such a way that makes it impossible to avoid harming yourself or teammates (i.e. no suicide weapons).
[/list]

If the gameplay of the server is modified substantially this must be indicated   clearly, preferably using the "serverdesc" and "servermotd" variables.

[list]
[*] If you wish to disable one or more weapons on the server, use the "sv_<weapon>disabled" variable. Letting players wield a weapon, but changing variables so that weapon doesn't actually work (such as by setting its damage output to 0) is not allowed.
[/list]

If the source code of the server is modified substantially you must contact the Red Eclipse Team to check that the changes are permitted by creating a topic in the official Red Eclipse discussion area at https://redeclipse.net/discuss

The server must honour the master server system, allowing global bans and granting the correct access by the Red Eclipse Team, or moderators assigned by them.

[list]
[*] Red Eclipse has a global authority system in place which is enforced for all servers that wish to be listed on the official master server to ensure the integrity of the project and surrounding community.
[/list]

The server must not advertise or otherwise spam messages excessively.

[list]
[*] Sending periodic messages regarding announcements, events, or sponsors is fine, so long as the messages aren't intrusive and sent more than once every three minutes.
[/list]

The server must not have a name that is offensive or send any messages that could be interpreted as offensive.

[list]
[*] Offensive language covers things such as bigotry (racist, religious, or sexually derogatory [gender or orientation] remarks)
[/list]

The owner of a server may outline their own rules, specific to their server.

[list]
[*] These rules may not revoke any part of this document.
[*] These rules must not make any unreasonable or illegal demands.
[/list]

Failure to follow these guidelines may result in the immediate ban and removal of the server in question from listing on the master server, without warning.

[b]Guidelines for Users[/b]

Players must behave in a manner that is not disruptive to the game.

[list]
[*] Cussing is fine, so long as it doesn't involve bigotry (racist, religious, or sexually derogatory [gender or orientation] remarks), unless a server is designated as "family friendly" and provides a clear definition of what kind of language is not permitted.
[*] Intentionally killing team mates or scoring for an opposing team is not permitted. This includes "kamikaze" tactics that result in negative scores.
[*] Cheating, flooding and/or spamming is not permitted. This includes sending too many messages via in-game communication over a short amount of time.
[/list]

The owner of a server may outline their own rules, specific to their server.

[list]
[*] Players on a server with additional rules must follow said rules unless the demands are unreasonable, illegal, or revoke part of this document.
[*] If any part of the rules supplied by a server violate this document, then all rules supplied by the server are considered to be null and void.
[/list]

Failure to adhere to follow these guidelines or a request by a moderator to follow them can result in an immediate mute, quarantine, kick, and/or ban, without warning, possibly from the Red Eclipse master server and all servers listed on it.

[list]
[*] It is important to note that moderators are considered to be representatives of the Red Eclipse community and should be treated with respect when performing their official duties.
[*] This does not include personal interactions with moderators outside the scope of the rules outlined in this document.
[*] Moderators are not obliged to disclose any information or provide an explanation regarding any disciplinary actions.
[/list]

Players may not circumvent any disciplinary action taken against them.

[list]
[*] This includes changing IP addresses to avoid the use of mute, quarantine, kick and/or ban applied either locally or globally by the Red Eclipse master server.
[/list]

If a player or moderator believes that the behaviour of any moderator is not supported by this document, it is advised that they lodge an official complaint in the "General Discussion" section of the official Red Eclipse discussions located at https://redeclipse.net/discuss

[list]
[*] Arguing or being otherwise antagonistic about official moderator decisions via in-game communication is not allowed.
[*] Attempting to mislead or otherwise deceive in a complaint is grounds for disciplinary action and may result in an immediate closing of the complaint.
[*] Lodging a complaint does not guarantee that action will be taken.
[*] The Red Eclipse Team is not obliged to disclose to the complainant what actions have or have not been taken.
[/list]

[b]Guidelines for Moderators[/b]

Moderators must act in a fair and impartial manner, employing the "warn, then kick, then ban" approach, unless there is an emergency or immediate need.

[list]
[*] It is important to remember moderators are considered to be official representatives of the Red Eclipse community and they should approach each situation in a professional manner.
[*] Extended verbal disputes with players in-game is not permitted and moderators are encouraged to ignore abuse from other players.
[*] The powers of a moderator should be not be used for personal disputes with another player or moderator.
[/list]

The use of mute, quarantine, kick, and/or ban should only be used when a user violates sections of this document. If in doubt, moderators should seek the advice of their peers (other players and/or moderators) before proceeding with disciplinary action.

[list]
[*] A moderator may mute, quarantine, kick, and/or ban for other reasons provided there is a sufficient reason that is causing a severe detriment.
[*] A moderator may not use mute, quarantine, kick, and/or ban as a way to silence a player who is simply being offensive or otherwise acting in a way that the moderator finds undesirable without violating this document.
[*] Personal opinions are not an enforceable reason for disciplinary action and moderators should not assume they are always right.
[/list]

Moderators should try to maintain a unified front when it comes to decision making in-game. If one moderator disagrees with the actions taken by another moderator it is advised that they discuss the situation before taking any further action.

[list]
[*] If there are multiple moderators online, they may opt work together to come to a consensus by a majority vote regarding whether to take further action. Any moderators who do not vote or remain silent are said to abstain.
[*] Further action includes undoing any disciplinary actions that have been carried out already. Moderator in-fighting is unprofessional behaviour.
[*] If a resolution can not be found then efforts should be made to find a more senior member of the Red Eclipse Team to mediate the dispute.
[*] Mediation methods may include an open topic in the "General Discussion" section of the official Red Eclipse discussions located at https://redeclipse.net/discuss for the community to weigh in on and generate a better consensus on the topic.
[/list]

If a moderator believes that any player behaviour not covered by this document should result in disciplinary action, they should create a topic in the "General Discussion" section of the official Red Eclipse discussions located at https://redeclipse.net/discuss

[list]
[*] Moderators should remember that it is important to maintain a professional attitude when dealing with other players and arguing or being otherwise antagonistic outside of executing disciplinary actions is not advised.
[*] Attempting to mislead or otherwise deceive in a report is grounds for disciplinary action and may result in an immediate closing of the report.
[/list]

Failure by a moderator to follow or uphold the rules may result in their access being immediately restricted or revoked, without warning.

[list]
[*] The Red Eclipse Team is not obliged to disclose what actions have or have not been taken.
[/list]

[b][u]The Red Eclipse Mark Policy[/u][/b]

[b]General Guidelines[/b]

The purpose of the Red Eclipse mark policy is to encourage the widespread use of Red Eclipse marks by the community while controlling the use of the marks in order to avoid confusion on the part of software users and the general public, to maintain the value of the image and reputation of the marks and to protect them from inappropriate or unauthorized use.

Any use of any Red Eclipse mark must be in accordance with this policy. Any use that does not comply with our trademark policy is not authorized.

Marks cover the following items: The name "Red Eclipse", the Red Eclipse emblem (without text) and the Red Eclipse logo (with word art text).

Do not assume that this policy will answer every question about the use of Red Eclipse marks, if in doubt, contact the Red Eclipse project.

[b]Declaration[/b]

The Red Eclipse project declares that:

1. For the purposes of tax, trademarks, copyrights, and ownership, Red Eclipse is considered to be the property of Mr Quinton Reeves as sole proprietor executed from the province of Australia, as is produced as a hobby project for no profit.

2. For the purposes of identifying adjoining identifying names for tax, trademarks, copyrights, and ownership, the following terms are considered synonymous with the sole proprietor of the project, Mr Quinton Reeves: - Red Eclipse - Red Eclipse Community - Red Eclipse Developer(s) - Red Eclipse Owner(s) - Red Eclipse Project - Red Eclipse Team

3. The official contact methods are, but not limited to: - Discussions: https://redeclipse.net/discuss - Bugs and Issues: https://redeclipse.net/issues

4. Personal information and contact details for Mr Quinton Reeves is available to eligible organisations on request.

[b]Permitted Use[/b]

You may use the marks without prior written permission (subject to the following terms):

1. To refer to the Red Eclipse software in substantially unmodified form.

[list]
[*] "Substantially unmodified" for source code means built from the source code provided by The Red Eclipse project, possibly with minor modifications including but not limited to: the enabling or disabling of certain features by default, translations into other languages, changes required for compatibility with a particular operating system distribution, the inclusion of bug-fix patches, or the bundling of additional extensions.
[*] "Substantially unmodified" for gameplay and art means using the game data provided by The Red Eclipse project, possibly with minor modifications, for example including additional maps, artwork, and sounds. The gameplay and art needs to closely resemble that of Red Eclipse in it's unmodified form, and not create an unfair advantage in gameplay.
[*] Example: You may modify Red Eclipse to start in windowed mode by default, but if you set the gravity in the game to zero, this counts as a substantial modification.
[*] Example: You may modify the laser beams to be green instead of purple, but if you change all the weapon models into fresh fruits, this counts as a substantial modification.
[/list]

2. To identify Red Eclipse as a distinct component of a software offering.

3. To factually refer to The Red Eclipse project itself, its products, or its protocols.

[list]
[*] Example: You may use "Bob's Add-ons for Red Eclipse" or "Bob's forum for Red Eclipse" but not "Bob's Red Eclipse".
[/list]

4. When referring to Red Eclipse that is substantially modified, to say that such software is a "derivative of" or "based on" Red Eclipse. You may use the marks as part of the name of a product designed to work with Red Eclipse, so long as the name as a whole (via its other components) clearly and unambiguously distinguishes the product from Red Eclipse, and the general presentation of the product does not imply any official association or identity with the Red Eclipse project.

[b]Non Permitted Use[/b]

You may not use the marks in the following ways:

1. In any way likely to cause confusion as to the identity of the Red Eclipse project, the origin of its software, or the software's license.

2. In any way that indicates a greater degree of association between you and Red Eclipse project than actually exists.

3. In any way that implies a designated successor to Red Eclipse (e.g., "Red Eclipse++" is not permitted).

4. In any way that indicates that the Red Eclipse project favours one distribution, platform, product, etc. over another except where explicitly indicated in writing by the Red Eclipse project.

5. In any way that promotes the use of third party services over those provided by Red Eclipse.

6. In any way that could be deemed harmful or disruptive to the Red Eclipse community and/or project.

Thus uses of the marks in a domain name or company name without explicit written permission from the Red Eclipse project are prohibited.

[b]Other Legal Notes[/b]

The Red Eclipse project reserves the sole right to:

1. Determine compliance with this policy.

2. Modify this policy to preserve the rights of Red Eclipse, the public, the community, and the users. The latest version of the Red Eclipse Mark Policy should be available at 

3. Grant exceptions to this policy, of any kind and for any reason whatsoever, other clauses notwithstanding.

[b]Other Use[/b]

If you have questions regarding the policy, or if any of the examples are unclear, feel free to contact the Red Eclipse project using the details provided in the declaration above.

If you would like to use the Red Eclipse marks for any other use, please contact us and we'll discuss a way to make that happen. We don't have strong objections to people using the name for their websites and businesses, but we do need the chance to review such use.

In other words, it's not a big deal, and a short conversation (via the forums for example) should clear everything up in short order.

If you currently have a product that is using the Red Eclipse marks in a way that don't follow this policy, don't panic. Let us know, and we'll work it out, as described above.
